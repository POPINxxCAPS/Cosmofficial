When it runs out, it will stop providing shields until fully powered once again. Your ship will begin to take real damage in this time. There will be dedicated shield blocks when I make tiered jump drives.

    There is a client-side issue where blocks look like they are being damaged, but they aren't. A simple re-log fixes the issue and you can see the actual health values of your blocks.
